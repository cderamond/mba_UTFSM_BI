## Questions

1.  A data analyst working in your group reports to you that he is
    developing a k-NN model to predict the yearly sales to potential new
    customers, and that he is currently using a k-fold cross-validation
    procedure to settle on the best value for k. Explain this to your
    boss.

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

2.  How do we prevent Euclidean distance from being biased by attributes
    with wide ranges of values?

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

3.  In a sentence or two, explain how k (in “k-NN”) is related to model
    complexity.

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

4.  A data analyst working for you reports that she has decided to use a
    standard OLS linear regression model instead of a weighted k-NN
    regression model, even though the k-NN regression model seems to be
    providing slightly higher accuracy on the holdout test set, because
    she believes that you will have to explain the model in great detail
    in order to get support from important stakeholders within the
    organization. What does she mean? Do you agree with her?

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

5.  Why would we want to perform some type of feature selection before
    building a k-NN model? Name one feature selection method for
    categorical target variables and one for numeric target variables.

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

6.  A data analyst reports to you that the team is building a
    “similarity-moderated k-NN regression model, using Manhattan
    distance instead of Euclidean distance.” What does that (whole
    phrase) mean?

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

7.  You report to your boss that your data science team is building a
    k-means cluster model to help better understand whether or not your
    customers occur in natural groupings. He laughs and says, “I don’t
    know what a k-means cluster model is. Matter of fact, I don’t even
    know what a cluster model is.” How would you further explain it to
    him in simple terms?

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

8.  Explain the k-means clustering algorithm by writing out the steps as
    bullet points or a numbered list.

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

9.  How can supervised learning be used to develop good cluster
    descriptions?

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

10. What is the difference between a characteristic description (of a
    cluster) and a differential description?

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

11. What is the difference between the R functions lapply() and
    vapply()? Structure your answer around the advantages and
    disadvantages of each.

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

12. Explain what the following R code is doing, and try to guess why we
    would do this. Assume that you know that the churn.csv dataset has
    20,000 rows. churn_data \<- read.csv(‘churn.csv’) idx \<-
    sample(1:nrow(churn_data), 16000) churn_train \<- churn_data\[idx,\]
    churn_test \<- churn_data\[-idx,\]

This is standar procedure to read a CSV data source and split it into
randomized train and test set

        churn_data <- read.csv('churn.csv') # read data
        idx <- sample(1:nrow(churn_data), 16000) #split index with 16k samples from the length of dataset
        churn_train <- churn_data[idx,] # define train set
        churn_test <- churn_data[-idx,] # define test set

13. Which R function would you use to randomly draw some numbers from
    the standard normal distribution?

``` r
rnorm(20)
```

    ##  [1] -0.06417472 -0.36919629 -1.50603087  1.52603116  2.04976304  0.20971139
    ##  [7] -0.37521636 -0.24087802  0.83343494 -1.22106453 -0.83320085 -0.30502296
    ## [13]  0.68383939 -1.94937311  2.30690981 -0.48276371  0.20520861 -1.13173267
    ## [19] -1.81334839  0.68238278

14. Which R function would you use to get the current date from the
    system?

``` r
    Sys.time()
```

    ## [1] "2022-11-12 21:46:20 -03"

15. What is a POSIX date? Is type of data that stores Date and time
    along with timezone.

``` r
    a <-Sys.time()
    str(a)
```

    ##  POSIXct[1:1], format: "2022-11-12 21:46:20"

``` r
    as.POSIXlt(a, tz="UTC" ) #same but UTC instead
```

    ## [1] "2022-11-13 00:46:20 UTC"
