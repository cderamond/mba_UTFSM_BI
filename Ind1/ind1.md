# Individual Assignment
Using the concepts discussed in class develop a case for business intelligent design in your organization. Consider these questions as a starting point: 
* _What challenges will your organization face in implementing?_
* _What opportunities exist?_
* _What is the strategic fit with your firm?_

# Current challenges

| **Business** | **Data & Tech** |
|------- | ------ |
| Quick inorganic growth | Spaghetti architecture |
| _VUCA_ environment | Compliance with GDPR   |
| Rise of EV  | Performance and security  |
| Omnichannel  | Dataful processes & interactions  |

# Identified Opportunities
1. Stablish a decentralized framework for 3rd party ingestion of data into DL. 

2. Stablish clear domains and ownership of data, thus allowing broader access to local teams to do self service reporting leveraging already available data sets and trnsformations.

3. Alongside with HR, se clear goals of baseline understanding into the tools (SQL, data literacy).
---
4. Cocreate with leadership at local levels shared KPI's for every data initiative, thus allowing to reduce cycle of experimentation (rapidly kill what's not generating value).

5. Enable startup-like pursue of local experiments with potential for scale -and kill 'em off quickly- with clear process and business case intake and evaluation.

# Strategic fit

* There is no suprise here, as we go into the strategy for the business one of the pillars is becoming truly data driven. In that same regards, creating and nurtiring an internal team with all necessary capabilities **Data Analytic Platform** independent from overall IT structure gives the freedom and flexibility to adapt.

* In order to truly engage and empower local teams, the removal of bottlenecks (dependency and permission from global teams), is a challenge that is clear by the opportunnities.
-----
* A stablished global portfolio of **_use cases_** that is being handled as data products, ensures quicker cycles to return. However, the organization must not lose sight of "other things" that may or not fit such portfolio.
